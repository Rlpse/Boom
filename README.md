I restarted the whole concept.
It is now a 2D dungeon based shooter, with enemies and bosses. 
It is still W.I.P (Work in progress).
Hopefully, meet up with the 3 month time space. 
Going really well I am developing more knowledge in how to code.
Don't know what to name it.
Android or PC?
Haven't gotten round to adding a main menu yet.
